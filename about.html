<p>In order to generate a <i>notarization announcement</i>, someone with our private key submits the document to the blockchain via our <a href="http://proofofexistence.com" target="_blank">Proof of Existence</a> server.  The PGP message you see on any notary announcement page is then linked ot a record in the blockchain.  You can also verify the notary announcement by downloading the PGP message, and decrypting it using your GPG tool of choice.</p>

<p>We use version control to keep permanent record of these notary announcements.  In addition to finding these annoucements here, you can find them on <a href="https://github.com/camera-v/camera-v.github.io" target="_blank">our github page</a>.  Every once in awhile, we will commit all new annoucements to a repository where they can be audited publicly.</p>
